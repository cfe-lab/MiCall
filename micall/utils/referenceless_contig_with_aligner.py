"""
High-level utilities for referenceless contig overlap discovery and anchoring
with lightweight local alignment.

What this module provides
-------------------------
- A contig wrapper (`ContigWithAligner`) exposing multiple aligner views over the
  same sequence:
  - generic mapping anywhere (mappy)
  - anchored-to-left and anchored-to-right mappings (forward/reversed)
- A convolution-based scorer (`find_maximum_overlap`) that estimates the most
  likely relative placement (shift) between two contigs without a reference.
- A thin adapter (`map_overlap`) that prepares and queries the appropriate
  aligner depending on the stitching relation being tested.

Why this exists (in the stitcher)
---------------------------------
The referenceless stitcher needs two complementary capabilities:
1) Coarse placement: roughly where should two contigs sit relative to each other?
   We answer this with a fast convolution across softened one-hot encodings of
   nucleotides. The result is a shift maximizing expected match count, later
   turned into an overlap score.
2) Local, end-aware anchoring: once a candidate window is known, we need to
   decide how much of each side to trust and align. For this, we use mappy in a
   controlled way to act like "align to left end" or "align to right end". The
   stitcher uses the returned anchor points to compute conservative cutoffs of
   the overlap to align and score (see referenceless_contig_stitcher.py:
   cutoffs_left_* / cutoffs_right_* and friends).

    Before aligning, we optionally present a trimmed view of the contig to the

    length derived from `minimum_score`. This saves work and avoids infeasible
    searches when the required score cannot be attained with the full contig.

      Tuples of (start, end) in coordinates of the original contig. For anchored
