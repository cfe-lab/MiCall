def calculate_overlap_score(L: int, M: int) -> Score:
    """
    Computes a monotonic scoring metric for an overlap between two
    sequences over a four-letter alphabet. It measures how much the
    observed match count M in an overlap of length L deviates from its
    expectation under a four-letter model, with a scaling exponent
    chosen to reflect the correlated nature of real genomic sequences.

    Derivation
    ----------
    1.  Uniform four-letter alphabet (match probability p = 1/4):
          - Expected matches:
                E[M] = L * p = L * 1/4
          - Independent-match variance:
                Var[M] = L * p * (1 - p) = L * 1/4 * (1 - 1/4) = L * (1/4 - 1/16)
          - Independent-match standard deviation:
                SD[M] = sqrt(Var[M]) = sqrt(L * (1/4 - 1/16))
          - Classic z-score for M:
                z = (M - E[M]) / SD[M] = (M - L * 1/4) / sqrt(L * (1/4 - 1/16))

    2.  Correlated-match model:
          - Real DNA (repeats, conserved motifs, low-complexity regions)
            exhibits long-range correlations so that
                SD[M] ∝ L^a
            with empirical estimates
                a ≈ 0.8.

    3.  Generalized overlap score:
          - Replace the sqrt(L) scaling with ^a, giving
                score = (M - L * 1/4) / ((L * (1/4 - 1/16))^a)

    4.  Optimizations:
          - Multiplying by L^-a avoids an explicit (slower) division:
                score = (M - L * 1/4) * ((L * (1/4 - 1/16))^-a)
          Constant factors rescale every score equally and do not affect ordering.
          - With that we multiply the first factor by 4 to eliminate division operation:
                score = (4 * M - L) * ((L * (1/4 - 1/16))^-a)
          - Expanding exponentiation we get another constant factor:
                score = (4 * M - L) * (L^-a * (1/4 - 1/16)^-a)
          - We eliminate the constant part:
                score = (4 * M - L) * (L^-a)

    This score preserves the monotonic "rarity" ordering of overlaps
    (higher ⇒ more unexpected), while penalizing long overlaps more
    strongly than the independent-match model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    L : int
        Length of the overlap (must be > 0).
    M : int
        Number of matching characters (0 <= M <= L).

    Returns
    -------
    Score
        A monotonic overlap score based on z-score.
