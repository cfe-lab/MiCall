    The genotyping assay was developed and its performance characteristics
    determined by the testing laboratory. The sequence results were generated
    by the testing laboratory, and sequence interpretations performed via an
    automated service developed at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS and
    hosted on Illumina BaseSpace. Interpretation is done by Stanford HIVdb
    algorithm, of phenotypic change for protease/RT and integrase sequences.
    Please see https://hivdb.stanford.edu/ for further information. Mutations
    detected above a prevalence of 5% of the total reads are reported here, and
    resistance levels were based on HIVdb scores of Susceptible (0-14),
    Low-level Resistance (15-29), Intermediate Resistance(30-59), and
    High-level Resistance(60+). The BC Centre (and Illumina) cannot be held
    responsible for the quality, integrity and correctness of the sequence
    results or use of this report in clinical care. For US clients, this report
    has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

    Mutations in NS3, NS5A and NS5B were detected by deep sequencing of HCV.
    The mutations considered and the interpretation algorithm can be found at
    http://cfe-lab.github.io/MiCall/hcv_rules1.7 . Mutations relative to genotype-specific
    reference sequences detected above a prevalence of 5% of the total coverage
    are reported here. This resistance scoring algorithm is still in
    development and should be regarded as investigational; it is currently
    defined as "Research Use Only". Patient management should not be based
    solely on drug susceptibility results provided in this report. The clinical
    response to the treatment regimen depends on many factors including patient
    disease status, viral load, number and types of direct acting antivirals
    and treatment duration.
