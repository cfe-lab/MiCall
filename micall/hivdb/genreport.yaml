  The genotyping assay was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the testing laboratory. The sequence results were generated by the testing laboratory, and sequence interpretations performed via an automated service developed at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS and hosted on Illumina BaseSpace. Interpretation is done by Stanford HIVdb algorithm, of phenotypic change for protease/RT and integrase sequences. Please see https://hivdb.stanford.edu/ for further information.  Mutations detected above a prevalence of 5% of the total reads are reported here. The BC Centre (and Illumina) cannot be held responsible for the quality, integrity and correctness of the sequence results or use of this report in clinical care. For US clients, this report has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
