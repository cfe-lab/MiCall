subtitle: Processing MiSeq Run Folders on Your Own Computer
---

MiCall is a powerful pipeline for processing FASTQ data from an
Illumina MiSeq. This guide focuses on running MiCall locally on your
personal computer --- using Docker for portability and ease of
installation --- in order to analyze a folder of MiSeq samples. This
local mode is intended for hands--on analysis of a single run folder,
as opposed to the fully automated server deployments (such as using
MiCall watcher).

When you want to process a few FASTQ files or MiSeq run folders
outside of a fully automated setup, the best solution is to run MiCall
locally using Docker. Docker bundles all of MiCall's dependencies in a
portable container, removing the hassle of installing multiple
packages. Before diving in, please ensure your machine meets the
prerequisites described below.

## Prerequisites and Docker Setup

- A modern operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows with Docker
  support).
- Docker installed on your computer. Follow the official instructions
  on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you
  have successfully run a container before (for example, the
  "hello-world" image), you are ready for MiCall.
- Recommended minimum resources: at least 1 GB of RAM and a multi-core
  CPU.

MiCall is hosted on Docker Hub under the repository
"cfelab/micall". To pull the latest stable (non-dev) image, open your
terminal and run:

```shell
docker pull cfelab/micall
```

It is a good idea to check the Docker Hub tags to select a version of
MiCall that suits your needs. Once you have pulled the desired tag,
you can verify its help message by running, for example:

```shell
docker run cfelab/micall --help
```

# Preparing Your Input Data

MiCall expects the input to be organized as a MiSeq run folder. This folder should contain:

- FASTQ files for forward and reverse reads (optionally compressed as `.fastq.gz`).
- A Sample Sheet (typically named `SampleSheet.csv`) if available, which helps with pairing and metadata extraction.
- Additional quality files (such as the `InterOp` folder) generated by the MiSeq.

For a hands--on trial, you might want to download an example dataset from the project's [Github --- Example Inputs](https://github.com/cfe-lab/MiCall/tree/example-inputs) and arrange the files in a directory similar to:

```plaintext
/your_project_directory/
    SampleSheet.csv
    1234A_R1.fastq.gz
    1234A_R2.fastq.gz
    ...
    results/         <-- (an empty folder to capture outputs)
```

# Running MiCall Locally Using Docker

For local analysis, MiCall's "folder" mode processes an entire run
folder. When running via Docker, you need to bind mount both your
input folder and a dedicated results folder. For instance, if your
current working directory is the run folder and you wish to store
outputs in a `./results` folder, run:

```shell
docker run --rm -v .:/data cfelab/micall folder --project HIVB --skip trim.censor --denovo --keep_scratch . results
```

In this command:

- The `--rm` option removes the container when it finishes, helping to
  keep your system tidy.
- The local run folder is mounted inside the container as `/data`,
  ensuring MiCall has access to your FASTQ files, SampleSheet, and
  other resources.
- The "folder" subcommand tells MiCall to process all available
  samples.
- Options such as `--project` (here set to HIVB) specify the primer
  set to use (for example, for HIV tests), while `--skip trim.censor`
  instructs MiCall to bypass certain quality filtering steps.
- The `--denovo` flag activates de novo assembly mode, and
  `--keep_scratch` preserves intermediate files to aid in
  troubleshooting if needed.

A few additional Docker tips:

- Passing the environment variable `COLUMNS` (for example, using `-e
  COLUMNS=$COLUMNS`) can improve help message formatting.
- If you forget to clean up, you may list containers with `docker ps
  -a` and remove them individually (or run `docker container prune
  -f`).

# Overview of the Local Analysis Pipeline

When you run MiCall locally, the pipeline performs several key steps:

1. **Quality Assessment and Filtering**

   MiCall first reads file-specific quality information (for example,
   phiX error rates from the InterOp files) and produces a quality
   summary. It then trims the FASTQ reads to remove low-quality bases
   and adapter sequences.

2. **Mapping and De Novo Assembly**

   The pipeline maps reads against a set of reference sequences or, if
   requested, employs de novo assembly tools to construct contigs from
   scratch. For HIV resistance testing, for instance, a remapping mode
   may be used to refine consensus sequences.

3. **Consensus Generation and Coverage Mapping**

   Based on read alignments, consensus sequences are computed and
   coverage maps are generated. These visualizations illustrate read
   depth variations across genomic regions.

4. **Resistance Reporting (when applicable)**

   If running resistance analysis for HIV or HCV, additional modules
   generate resistance calls according to predefined rule sets.

Key output files include aligned data (`aligned.csv`), nucleotide and
amino acid counts (`nuc.csv`, `amino.csv`), consensus sequences
(`conseq.csv`), genome coverage maps, and resistance reports if the
analysis is configured for that purpose.

## Customizing and Troubleshooting Your Run

MiCall offers a range of command-line options to fine-tune your
analysis. For example, you can adjust parameters to skip certain
steps, change the quality cutoff thresholds, or select different
primer sets (using the `--project` option). To see the full list of
options, simply run:

```shell
docker run --rm cfelab/micall --help
```

If you experience issues --- such as error messages like "No such file
or directory," empty results, or performance problems --- ensure that:

- Your bind mount paths are correct and accessible by Docker.
- Your input folder contains all the necessary files in the expected
  format.
- System resources (RAM, CPU) are sufficient, and consider closing
  other applications if needed.
- For mapping issues, you might add the `--debug_remap` flag to gain
  additional insight into the process.

# Summary

By following this guide, you can effectively run MiCall locally using
Docker. Whether you are processing first--hand MiSeq run folders for
research or to experiment with de novo assembly and resistance
scoring, this integrated local analysis and getting-started guide
empowers you to harness the full potential of MiCall on your own
system. Once you are comfortable with local runs, you can further
explore advanced features, such as custom assembly settings and
detailed troubleshooting tools, ensuring that every step of MiCall's
pipeline is transparent and customizable.

Happy analyzing!
