title: MiCall
description: Processing FASTQ data from an Illumina MiSeq
---

Maps all the reads from a sample against a set of reference sequences, then
stitches all the reads into consensus sequences and coverage maps.

A monitoring system regularly checks the file system for unprocessed runs,
transfers FASTQ.gz files to the cluster and executes the pipeline.

See the [list of steps and files][steps] for details of what the pipeline does.
The [admin] page describes how to look after the pipeline.
