    HIV-1 particles use coreceptors to enter cells. Different particles can use
    CXCR4, CCR5, or both. This analysis looks at the sequences from a virus
    population and reports either "X4" (able to use CXCR4) or "R5" (only able
    to use CCR5). See the [design page][fastq_g2p_design] for more details.

    that came from this set of counts
  * refseq.aa.pos - the 1-based index of the amino acid in the coordinate reference
  * A,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,N,P,Q,R,S,T,V,W,Y - counts for the amino acids at this
    position
  * `*` - count of stop codons at this position
  * X - count of codons with at least one nucleotide with a Phred quality score
    below the cutoff

    codons at either end of a read are not counted at all)
  * del - count of codons with a deletion relative to the coordinate reference
  * ins - count of codons with an insertion in or after them relative to the
    coordinate reference
  * clip - count of reads with soft clipping that would have mapped at this
    codon

    V3LOOP G2P mapping and were ignored.
* amino_detail.csv - same fields as amino.csv
* blast.csv
  * contig_name - name that appears in amino_detail.csv and nuc_detail.csv
  * ref_name - reference name that BLAST found matches in
  * score - calculated by BLAST
  * match - fraction of the sequence that matched the reference, negative for
    reverse-complemented matches

  * aligned - aligned with a reference and merged with mate
* conseq.csv
  * region - seed region it mapped to
  * q-cutoff - minimum quality score

    up at least this fraction of the total valid counts
  * offset - using the seed reference's coordinate system, this is the 1-based
    index of the first character in the consensus sequence.
  * sequence - the consensus sequence, aligned to the codon reading frame.
    Adding the number of dashes in offset will align the first base in the
    consensus sequence with its corresponding base in the seed reference. The
    whole consensus sequence may not be aligned with the seed reference because
    of insertions and deletions. Mixtures above the cutoff are displayed as
    [IUPAC nucleotide codes]. If deletions are present above the cutoff, the
    nucleotide code is lower case. If coverage is below 100 or if the only thing
    present above the cutoff is deletions, the nucleotide code is "x".
* conseq_all.csv: same columns as conseq.csv, with two different offsets:
  * seed-offset - offset of the seed relative to the reference
  * region-offset - offset of the seed relative to the region
* conseq_region.csv: same columns as conseq.csv
* conseq_stitched.csv: our best guess at a whole genome consensus, stitched
  together from the individual regions' consensus sequences, at different mixture levels.
  Insertions are included and gaps are not filled. In areas where multiple 
  regions overlap, we prioritize translated regions (because the amino acid alignment is 
  more precise), and we prioritize information from the centre of the region over information 
  from the edge of the region (again because the alignment in the centre is more reliable).
