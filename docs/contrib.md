## Development

The easiest way to start developing MiCall is by using DevContainers.

1. **Open Project**:
    - If you're using Visual Studio Code on your local machine, open the MiCall project folder and select the "Reopen in Container" prompt to initialize the DevContainer environment. Make sure you have the necessary DevContainer extension installed beforehand, available [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
    - For a web-based development environment, you can develop directly on GitHub using GitHub Codespaces by navigating to the MiCall repository on GitHub and selecting "Code" > "Open with Codespaces" to launch a pre-configured environment.

2. **Dependency Installation**: All required dependencies will be automatically installed whether you are using a local DevContainer or GitHub Codespace.

3. **Interpreter Selection**:
    - Following the setup, if you encounter dependency errors, manually select the Python interpreter version `3.8`. This is necessary because the container includes multiple Python versions, and the default selection might not be appropriate.
    - This issue is tracked and further details can be found [here](https://github.com/cfe-lab/MiCall/issues/1033).

4. **Verification**: To ensure that the environment is correctly configured, execute `pytest` within the DevContainer or Codespace. All tests should pass, indicating that the setup is successful.

### Local install

To see how all the tools should be installed, follow the steps in `Dockerfile`
and `dev.dockerfile`. If you prefer, you can run your development environment
under docker, as described in `dev.dockerfile`. The same installation steps are
also listed in the `Singularity` file. The docker file runs with debian, and the
singularity file runs with CentOS.

### Python

Check that Python is already installed.

```shell
python --version
```

We have tested with Python `3.11`.

### BaseSpace

Set up the [native apps virtual machine][bsvm]. Make sure you have a
developer account on illumina.com. The first time you run this, you
will have to log in to your account using

```shell
sudo docker login docker.illumina.com
```

### Test data
If you want to run `micall watcher`, you have to set up data folders for raw
data and for the working folders. You'll also need to set up the QAI project
and the MiseqQCReport so you can download QC data and upload results.

1. Create a data folder somewhere on your workstation, like ~/data. Create
   subdirectories called miseq and RAW_DATA. Add folders RAW_DATA/MiSeq/runs.
2. Connect to the shared drive [using CIFS][cifs] and mount
   `smb://192.168.68.144/RAW_DATA` as `/media/RAW_DATA`.
3. Navigate down to /media/RAW_DATA/MiSeq/runs, pick a recent folder, and make
   sure it has a file named needsprocessing.
4. Copy SampleSheet.csv to a sample run folder under your local
   RAW_DATA/MiSeq/runs folder.
5. Navigate down to Data\Intensities\BaseCalls, and copy a few of the .fastq.gz
   files to your sample run folder under Data/Intensities/BaseCalls.
6. Copy the Interop folder and the files RunInfo.xml and runParameters.xml.
7. Open settings.py for editing.
8. Point `home` at your local data/miseq folder.
9. Point `rawdata_mount` at your local RAW_DATA folder.
10. Set the Oracle connection information to a test database where you can upload
   sequence data. (https://git-int.cfenet.ubc.ca/wscott/oracleserver)
11. Run the Ruby console for QAI and `LabMiseqRun.import('01-Jan-2000')` for the
    date of your sample run.
12. Upload the projects to a micall pipelines in QAI, use `micall.utils.projects_upload` to create a new pipeline in QAI
13. Run `micall watcher`, it does need arguments. Look up the container app ids from Kive, check the Kive server URL and ports as well as QAI server and port

### Looking at SAM files
When you don't understand the pipeline's output, it can be helpful to look at
the raw reads in a sequence viewer like [Tablet][tablet]. Run the `micall analyze`
command on a run folder or a single sample, like this:

```shell
micall analyze folder --debug_remap --all_projects --keep_scratch /path/to/run
```

The options tell it to write the debug files, use all projects, and save the
scratch folder that holds all the debug files. Look through the scratch folders
under the run folder to find
the one for the sample you're interested in. The remap step writes the mapping
results as `debug_remapX_debug.sam` and `debug_remapX_debug_ref.fasta`, where
`X` is the remapping iteration number. You should be able to open an assembly
in Tablet using those two files. If the SAM file contains multiple regions,
you'll probably have to sort it with the `micall/utils/sort_sam.py` script. That
same script can convert `prelim.csv` into a SAM file.

If you want to understand the de novo assembly process, read through the
[assembly page].

### GitHub Web Site

Most of the time, you can change the web site content just by editing the
markdown files in the `docs` folder. However, you may occasionally need to dig
into the page templates or do more serious work. If that happens, you can test
out the web site locally before publishing it.

```shell
# Enter MiCall's docs directory.
cd docs/
# Build and run the documentation website.
docker build --tag micall-documentation .
docker run \
       --volume .:/docs \
       --publish 4000:80 \
       --rm \
       --name micall-documentation \
       --interactive --tty \
       micall-documentation
# Goto http://localhost:4000
```

What changes might you want to make? The web site is based on the
[Bulma Clean Theme], so read through the documentation there to see if it
already has the feature you want. Usually, the advanced features require you
to write files in the `docs/_data` folder or add settings to the front matter
at the top of a markdown file.

If you have to add a new feature to the web site, you can override one of the
files in the theme by copying it into the `docs/_includes` folder, and making
changes there. Consider offering it back to the theme project as a pull request,
because any files you override won't get automatic improvements from the
original theme project.

### Releases
This section assumes you already have a working server up and running, and you
just want to publish a new release. If you're setting up a new server, follow
similar steps to setting up a development workstation. Follow these steps:

1. Check that all the issues in the current milestone are closed, and make sure
    the code works in your development environment. Run all the unit
    tests as described above, process the microtest data set with
    `micall/utils/release_test_microtest.py`.
2. Check if the kiveapi package needs a new release by looking for new commits.
    Make sure you tested with the latest version.
3. Determine what version number should be used next.
4. Use the `micall/utils/projects_dump.py` script for the previous version and compare
    `projects.json` to check that the projects match, or that the differences
    were intended. Test the `micall/utils/projects_upload.py` script with your updated project
    files in your local test QAI.
5. Check the history of the HIV and HCV rules files in the `micall/resistance`
    folder. If they have changed, create a new display file in the `docs` folder
    and upgrade the version numbers in the `genreport.yaml` file and
    `asi_algorithm.py`.
5. Check the history of the `micall.alignment` folder. If it has changed since
    the last release, then update the version number in `setup.py`.
5. Update the change notes in the Singularity file, and commit those changes.
6. [Create a release][release] on Github. Use "vX.Y.Z" as the tag, where X.Y
    matches the version you used in QAI. If you have to redo
    a release, you can create additional releases with tags vX.Y.Z.1, vX.Y.Z.2, and
    so on. Mark the release as pre-release until you finish deploying it.
7. Rebuild the Singularity image, and upload it to your local Kive server.
    Process the microtest data.
7. Upload the Singularity image to the Kive test server, and record the
    ids of the new apps.
8. Process all the samples from test_samples.csv on the Kive test server, and
    run the `micall_watcher` service on a VirtualBox. Use the
    `micall/utils/release_test_*.py` scripts to compare the results of the new release with
    the previous version. Also run the internal scripts `miseq_gen_results.rb`
    and `miseq_compare_results.rb` to look for differences. Get the comparison
    signed off to begin the release process.
8. Upload the Singularity image to the main Kive server, and
    record the id of the new apps.
9. Upload the pipeline definitions to QAI, using the `micall projects_upload`
    command. There is no need to create the new pipeline version in QAI beforehand,
    the command will do this for you - just remember to update the `Order by` field
    afterwards.
10. Stop the watcher service on the main Kive server after you check that
    it's not processing any important runs.

    ```shell
    ssh user@server
    tail /var/log/micall/micall.log
    sudo systemctl stop micall_watcher
    ```

11. Get the code from Github into the server's environment.

    ```shell
    ssh user@server
    cd /usr/local/share/MiCall
    git fetch
    git checkout tags/vX.Y.Z
    ```

12. Look for changes in [`micall/monitor/watcher.py`'s `parse_args()` function][parse_args].
    Either look at the blame annotations at the link above, or review the
    changes in the new release. If there are new or changed settings, adjust
    the configuration in `/etc/systemd/system/micall_watcher.service` or
    `/etc/micall/micall.conf`.
13. Update the container app ids and pipeline version number in
    `/etc/systemd/system/micall_watcher.service`. If you change the configuration, reload it:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

14. Check that the kiveapi package is the same version you tested with. If not,
    do a Kive release first.

    ```shell
    cd /usr/local/share/Kive
    /usr/local/share/venv-micall/bin/pip show kiveapi
    cat api/setup.py
    ```

15. Start the watcher service, and tail the log to see that it begins
    processing all the runs with the new version of the pipeline.

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl start micall_watcher
    sudo systemctl status micall_watcher
    tail -f /var/log/micall/micall.log
    ```

    If the log doesn't help, look in `/var/log/messages` on CentOS or
    `/var/log/syslog` on Ubuntu.

16. Launch the basespace virtual machine (see BaseSpace section above) and copy
    MiCall source files into it. The easiest way to copy is via scp:

    ```shell
    scp -P 2222 /path/to/micall/on/host basespace@localhost:MiCall
    # (password is "basespace")
    ```

    Then login to virtual machine and build the docker image:

    ```shell
    ssh basespace@localhost -p2222     # (password is "basespace")
    sudo python3 MiCall/micall/utils/docker_build.py -t vX.Y.Z --nopush
    ```

    The script is able to push the docker image to the illumina repo and launch
    spacedock as well, but that is currently broken because of the old docker version
    in the VM. If this is ever updated, or we build our own VM, you won't have to do these
    steps manually anymore and can remove the `--nopush`.

17. Tag the same docker image and push it to docker hub and illumina.
    Unfortunately, the old
    version of docker that comes with the basespace virtual machine
    [can't log in] to docker hub or illumina, so you'll have to save it to a tar file and
    load that into your host system's version of docker. Before pushing it anywhere,
    check that the docker image works by running the microtests.
    If the docker push fails with mysterious error messages (access to the resource
    is denied), try `docker logout` and `docker login` again, and make sure you are
    on the owner team of cfelab on [docker hub].

    ```shell
    ssh basespace@localhost -p2222  # password is "basespace"
    sudo su
    sudo docker save cfelab/micall:vX.Y.Z > micall-vX.Y.Z.tar
    exit  # Exit the root shell.
    exit  # Exit the virtual machine.
    sudo docker load < micall-vX.Y.Z.tar
    sudo docker login docker.illumina.com
    sudo docker tag docker.illumina.com/cfe_lab/micall:vX.Y.Z cfelab/micall:vX.Y.Z
    sudo docker push docker.illumina.com/cfe_lab/micall:vX.Y.Z
    rm micall-vX.Y.Z.tar
    ```

18. Duplicate the MiCall form in the revisions section of the form builder, then
    edit the `callbacks.js` in the form builder itself, and add the `:vX.Y.Z` tag to the
    `containerImageId` field. In My Apps, create a new version of the App with the new
    version number. Record the new agent ID (click the arrow on the bottom right of the
    form builder).
19. Launch the spacedock version by running this in your basespace VM:

    ```shell
    sudo spacedock -a [agent ID] -m https://mission.basespace.illumina.com
    ```

20. Check that the new MiCall version works as expected by processing some of the
    microtests in BaseSpace.
21. Activate the new revisions in the form builder and the report builder.
22. Submit the new revision of the MiCall app for review, and ask our contact
    at Illumina to set the price to zero for the list of test users.
23. Send an e-mail to users describing the major changes in the release.
24. Close the milestone for this release, create one for the next release, and
    decide which issues you will include in that milestone.
25. When the release is stable, check that it's included on the [Zenodo] page.
    If you included more than one tag in the same release, the new tags have
    not triggered Zenodo versions. Edit the release on GitHub, copy the
    description text, update the release, then click the Delete button. Then
    create a new release with the same description, and that will trigger a
    Zenodo version.
