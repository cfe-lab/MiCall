# MiCall #
## Processing FASTQ data from an Illumina MiSeq ##
Maps all the reads from a sample against a set of reference sequences, then
stitches all the reads into consensus sequences and coverage maps.

A monitoring system regularly checks the file system for unprocessed runs,
transfers FASTQ.gz files to the cluster and executes the pipeline.

  * avg_coverage - average coverage across the best region for each sample
* conseq.csv
  * consensus-percent-cutoff - to be included in a mixture, a variant must make

  * offset - using the seed reference's coordinate system, this is the 1-based
    index of the first character in sequence that is not a dash. For example, if
    the seed was `ACTAGTCC` and the consensus sequence is `-AGTC`, then the
    offset would be 4.
    ** change to ** the number of dashes that are not shown at the start of the
    sequence
  * sequence - the consensus sequence, aligned to the codon reading frame.
    ** once offset is changed, add the following **
    Adding the number of dashes in offset will align the first base in the
    consensus sequence with its corresponding base in the seed reference. The
    whole consensus sequence may not be aligned with the seed reference because
    of insertions and deletions
* nuc.csv
  * query.nuc.pos - the 1-based index of the base in the consensus sequence that
    came from this set of counts

  * region - coordinate reference for reporting against, usually a gene
  * qcut - minimum Phred quality score to include a nucleotide
  * left - the one-based position within the consensus sequence of the first
    amino acid in the insertion
  * insert - the insertion sequence of amino acids
  * count - the number of times the insertion occurred
  * before - the one-based position within the coordinate reference that it

* g2p.csv - calls individual sequences as either R5 or X4
  * rank - ranks each sequence within the sample, starting at 1 for the most
    common.
  * count - how many times this sequence appeared in the sample. (Note that the
    same amino acid sequence can be produced by different nucleotide sequences,
    and these are counted separately.)

  * error - reason for rejecting a sequence
    * low quality - more than half of the sequence had read quality with phred
        score < 33
    * notdiv3 - the sequence did not end on a codon boundary

        reference sequence
    * cysteines - the start or end of the amino acid sequence was not a cycsteine
    * > 2 ambiguous - more than one amino acid was ambiguous, or one position
        more than two possible amino acids
    * stop codons - the sequence contained a stop codon
    * length - the amino acid sequence length was outside of the range 32 to 40
    * failed to align - the nucleotide sequence failed to align with the reference
    * count < 3 - this is a summary line reporting how many reads were rejected
        for low counts
  * comment - a warning for sequences that had a problem but were good enough
    to score

  * X4pct - X4calls as a percentage of valid
  * final - the final decision: blank if valid is 0, X4 if X4pct >= 2, otherwise
    R5

## The MiCall Monitor ##

MiCall Monitor (or just Monitor) handles the automated processing of new MiSeq data
through the MiCall pipeline.  It periodically scans the `RAW_DATA` folder for data,
and when new data appears it interfaces with Kive to start the processing.
This folder is populated outside of MiCall:

* Runs get uploaded by the MiSeq to `RAW_DATA`.
* The `watch_runs.rb` script in that folder watches for the files to finish
    copying, and then creates a file named `needsprocessing` in the folder.
* The [MiseqQCReport][] scripts upload the QC data to QAI, and then create a 
`qc_uploaded` file.

The Monitor looks for folders with both of these flag files, and ignores ones
without.

### Hourly scan for new MiSeq runs ###

Every hour, Monitor looks for new data to process with the following procedure.

* Scan for folders that have a `needsprocessing` flag.  Any such folders get added 
to a list (in memory) of all run folders.  This distinguishes other random stuff or 
stuff that isn't ready to go from actual run folders.  The newest of these folders 
(going by the date in the folder name, *not* the filesystem creation date) is 
earmarked as The Newest Run, regardless of any processing that has already been 
done by older versions of MiCall.  Folders are visited in reverse chronological 
order based on the date in the folder name.

* Iterate through the run folder list in memory.  For each run folder, look for a 
results subfolder corresponding to the current version of MiCall (located in
`Results/version_X.Y`, where `X.Y` is the current version number) with a 
`doneprocessing` flag in it.  If this is identified, skip this folder (regardless 
of whether or not it's The Newest Run).

* When a run folder is found that does *not* have such a results folder, one of 
two things happens.  If this folder is The Newest Run, Monitor gets/creates a MiCall 
pipeline run for each sample, all at once (see "Get/Create Run" below).  All other 
folders have their samples added to an in-memory list of "Samples That Need Processing".
   
    * Get/Create Run: Monitor looks for the existence of the required datasets on Kive 
    (by both MD5 and filename) and creates them if they don't exist.  Then, Monitor 
    looks to see if this data is already being processed through the current version of 
    MiCall.  If not, it starts the processing.  Either way, the Kive processing task
    is added to an in-memory list of "Samples In Progress".
    
### Periodic load monitoring and adding new processing jobs ###

Every 30 seconds, Monitor checks on all Samples In Progress.

* If a MiCall sample is finished, and that is the last one from a given MiSeq run to 
finish, then all results for that run are downloaded into a subfolder specific to the 
current version of MiCall (located in `Results/version_X.Y` where `X.Y` is the current 
version number) in that run's corresponding folder in `RAW_DATA`, and a `doneprocessing` 
flag is added to that subfolder.  Post-processing (e.g. uploading stuff to QAI) occurs.

* Monitor keeps a specified lower limit of samples to keep active at any given time.  
If a MiCall sample finishes processing and the number of active samples dips below 
that limit, Monitor looks at its list of Samples That Need Reprocessing and starts 
the next one, moving it from that list to Samples In Progress.

### Ways to manipulate the order in which the Monitor processes data ###
Sometimes, you want to do unusual things. Here are a few scenarios we've run into.

#### You need to force Monitor to reprocess a given run ####
First, stop Monitor.  Remove the results subfolder for the current version of 
MiCall.  Restart Monitor.  On the next hourly scan, Monitor will handle this 
folder as if it had never been processed through the current version of MiCall.  That 
is, if it's The Newest Run, its samples will be immediately started and added to 
Samples In Progress, and if it's not The Newest Run, its samples will be added to 
Samples That Need Processing.

#### You need Monitor to skip a folder and handle an older one first ####
Stop Monitor.  Add an `errorprocessing` flag to the run's folder in `RAW_DATA`.  
This will make Monitor's next hourly scan believe that it's failed and should be 
skipped, and Monitor will move on to the next one.  Note though that this has no 
effect on which folder is The Newest Run: even if you're skipping The Newest Run, 
the next one down does not inherit the mantle.

* DO NOT delete the `needsprocessing` flag from a folder to try and keep Monitor from 
handling it.  This will cause Conan's scripts to reupload data to that folder.  

Restart Monitor.  After all samples from this run have finished processing, 
remove the fake `errorprocessing` flag you set (no need to stop and restart Monitor).

#### You need to stop what's currently running and handle an older run ####
Stop Monitor.  In Kive, stop the processing tasks that you need to clear out, 
but don't remove them; the progress you've already made can be reused later when 
revisiting these tasks later.  Now, do the manipulations you need to do as in the
above case to make Monitor deal with your desired run first.  Restart Monitor.

As in the above case, when you are ready to process the run you previously stopped,
you can remove the fake `errorprocessing` flag you created for that run, and Monitor
will then restart those processing tasks on its next hourly scan.  Kive will be able 
reuse the progress already made when you stopped them.
